SmeltingMetal
A Minecraft mod designed to add more depth and steps to the ore smelting process, encouraging players to build elaborate automation systems.

Overview
SmeltingMetal transforms the traditional direct smelting of raw ores into ingots into a multi-step process, introducing new challenges and opportunities for automation. Inspired by complex modpacks and the desire to integrate seamlessly with technical mods like Create, this mod makes obtaining metal ingots a more engaging and rewarding experience.

Features
Multi-Stage Smelting: Raw ore no longer directly yields ingots. Instead, it first smelts into molten metal.

Ingot Molding: Molten metal must then be poured into an ingot mold.

Water Cooling: A filled ingot mold requires a final step: right-clicking it on a water source to cool and solidify the molten metal into a usable ingot.

Automation Focus: The added steps are specifically designed to encourage and necessitate the use of automation solutions provided by other technical mods, such as item transportation, liquid handling, and automated crafting, making mods like Create even more valuable.

Compatibility
Minecraft Version: This mod is built for Minecraft 1.20.1.

Mod Integration: Designed to work well with and enhance the gameplay experience when combined with automation and technical mods like Create or similar tech-focused modifications.
